Response #1

Earth's atmosphere is composed of a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (78.08%) and oxygen (20.95%), along with trace amounts of other gases such as argon (0.93%), carbon dioxide (0.04%), neon, helium, methane, krypton, hydrogen, and ozone. 
Water vapor is also present in varying amounts, depending on the location and time. 
The composition of the atmosphere is crucial to maintaining life on Earth, as it provides the necessary gases for respiration and also helps regulate the planet's temperature through the greenhouse effect.

Response #2

Earth's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%) gases, with small amounts of other gases such as argon (about 0.93%) and carbon dioxide (about 0.04%). 
There are also trace amounts of neon, helium, methane, krypton, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, ozone, xenon, and other gases. 
The atmosphere also contains water vapor, which varies in concentration depending on the location and weather conditions. 
Additionally, there are aerosols, such as dust, salt, and other particles, that contribute to the composition of the atmosphere. 
The exact composition of the atmosphere can vary slightly depending on location, altitude, and other factors.
